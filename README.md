# VIS-Ohrwurm

VIS-Ohrwurm is a library that can be used in conjuction with the vis-framework. It uses MIREX algorithm implementations to conduct melodic searches.
Each folder in this repository is a separate project done by different researchers using a variety of methods. We have rewritten them (and in some cases written them for the first time) in Python, in order to use them with our VIS software, as well as to create uniformity between them. There are often multiple algorithms in each project. The details of these projects and the algorithms used can be found in each folder's readme.

## Installation

Each project has a list of requirements needed for it to run properly. Simple run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` from the subfolder you wish to use, and all the dependencies will be installed automatically.

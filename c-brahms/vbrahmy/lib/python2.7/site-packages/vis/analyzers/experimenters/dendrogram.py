    """
    Cluster VIS analysis profiles according to their similarity and output a dendrogram of the
    results using matplotlib and scipy. An "analysis profile" typically consists of all of the
    results of a given type of analysis, e.g. interval 2-grams, for a single piece. When the
    analysis profiles of two pieces are compared, the clustering algorithm determines how similar
    they are on the provided metric by evaluating to what extent they have the same percentage
    representation of each observation in the analysis profiles. Two pieces could theoretically
    have completely similar (shown as 0% dissimilar) analysis profileswhile still being different
    different pieces. This clustering process continues until all starting leaf nodes are clustered
    into one large group. The point of this type of analysis is to reveal latent structure in a
    dataset by showing how groups naturally form in the intermediary stages of clustering.

    All possible settings for the graph output have defaults. There are two sets of settings because
    the 'dendrogram_settings' get passed verbatim to the scipy function dendrogram(). For
    information about how these settings influence the dendrogram please see:
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram.html
    Note that if graph_settings['interactive_dendrogram'] == False and
    graph_settings['filename_and_type'] is None dendrogram_setting['no_plot'] will automatically be
    set to True. If neither of those two conditions obtain, dendrogram_settings['no_plot'] will
    automatically be set to False.

    The 'graph_settings' consist of all other necessary settings to do cluster analysis and to
    produce a dendrogram. Each setting does the following:

    :param label_connections: if True, display the percent dissimilarity of each dendrogram
        connection.
    :type label_connections: boolean, defaults to True
    :param connection_string: controls the appearance of the label_connections if they are activated.
        The first character sets the color from this choice of eight colors:
        http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html
        The second character sets the shape of the connection points from this list:
        http://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html
        If an empty string is passed but label_connections is still True, the number of each reading
        will still appear, but it will not be accompanied by a dot.
    :type connection_string: string of 0, 1, or 2 (most typical) characters in length.
    :param linkage_type: controls how clusters are compared for closeness and can be set to 'average',
        wherein the average distance of each point in one cluster to every point in the other cluster
        is taken to determine the disimilarity of those two clusters; 'single' where the closest two
        elements of two clusters is taken as the dissimilarity reading of the two clusters; or
        'complete' which takes the most dissimilar reading of any two elements, one from each cluster,
        to determine the distance of two clusters.
    :type linkage_type: string
    :param xlabel: assigns string to xlabel. If you want no label, pass an empty string.
    :type xlabel: string
    :param ylabel: assings string to ylabel. If you want no label, pass an empty string.
    :type ylabel: string
    :param title: assings string to dendrogram title. If you want no title, pass an empty string.
    :type title: string
    :param interactive_dendrogram: controls whether or no to produce a matplotlib interactive
        dendrogram. This is similar to the dendrogram_settings['no_plot'] setting but because of the
        added rendering in the form of axis labels, label connection annotations, etc. this switch
        is also necessary. If you don't want to produce an interactive dendrogram set this to False.
        The matplotlib dendrogram window is "interactive" in that you can zoom in and alter other
        aspects of the graph unlike the .pdf and .png formats which are immutable.
    :type interactive_dendrogram: boolean
    :param filename_and_type: set this to a filename ending in .pdf or .png if you want to save a
        pdf or a png of the dendrogram. If you don't add either type but do include a filename, the
        default type is .png.
    :type filename_and_type: None will not save a file. Otherwise a string with the filename
        followed by either .pdf or .png.
    :param return_data: Return just the data of the connections. If you don't want to spend time
        rendering the dendrogram too then you should set graph_settings['label_connections']: False,
        graph_settings['interactive_dendrogram']: False, and graph_settings['filename_and_type']:
        None. Setting interactive_dendrogram to False and filename_and_type to None will
        automatically set dendrogram_settings['no_plot']:True. The settings return_data,
        interactive_dendrogram, and filename_and_type are all kept separate so that the user can
        theoretically produce an interactive dendrogram, a static file, and return the data of the
        output as well, though I can't imagine that anyone would actually want to do all three at
        the same time. Any combination of the three outputs is also possible.
    :type return_data: boolean

            More than one such list can be provided if you want to cluster pieces according to

        """
        Determines the dissimilarity of each analysis pairing and puts them in a "matrix" which is
        the upper half of a permutation matrix. For example, if you want to do a hierarchical
        clustering analysis on four pieces, you will have 6 unique pairing which will each get a
        dissimilarity score. Here's an explanatory diagram of four pieces, A B C and D:
        ********************
        * | A | B | C | D  *
        *-|---|---|---|----*
        *A| x | 31| 22| 61 *
        *-|---|---|---|----*
        *B| x | x | 17| 80 *
        *-|---|---|---|----*
        *C| x | x | x | 44 *
        *-|---|---|---|----*
        *D| x | x | x | x  *
        ********************
        These similarities would be represented in the matrix as a list in this order:
        [31, 22, 61, 17, 80, 44]. These results show that pieces B and C are the most similar based
        on the metric analyzed given that they have the lowest dissimilarity score. By contrast B
        and D are the most dissimilar. The algorithm makes its calculations based on the percent
        representation of each observation in each piece, so issues arising from inequalities in
        length are minimized. Also, comparing A to B will get the same score as comparing B to A,
        which is why only the upper half of the dissimilarity matrix is needed.

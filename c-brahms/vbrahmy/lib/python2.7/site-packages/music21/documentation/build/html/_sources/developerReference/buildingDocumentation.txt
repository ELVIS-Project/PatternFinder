Building Documentation
==================================

Creating or updating the music21 documentation requires a few additional programs to be installed, 
most importantly one called Sphinx. Sphinx is a documentation generator that uses 
reStructuredText (rst) as its markup language and outputs HTML documents. 



**1) Install pip**

In order to get additional modules, you'll need a way of getting them more easily.  The easiest way to do this is to get `pip` (or `pip3` for Python3).  Just go to https://pip.pypa.io/ and they'll help you out.

**2) Downloading and Installing Sphinx**

Once pip is installed simply run: "sudo pip install sphinx"

**3) Install pandoc**

You can get pandoc (the universial documentation converter) at: http://pandoc.org/installing.html

**4) Run documentation/make.py** 

Find the documentation folder within music21. And run with python or python3 the `make.py` file, which will automatically build all the music modules in music21 into the "autogenerated" folder and from there into the "build/html" folder.

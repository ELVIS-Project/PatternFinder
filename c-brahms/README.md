# C-Brahms

## The Algorithms

## Running Scripts

Query and source files are passed in by file name, using relative file names from the c-brahms directory. There are two use cases:

1) with one source file

    $ python find_matches.py source query

2) with a directory of source files

    $ python find_matches.py -d directory query

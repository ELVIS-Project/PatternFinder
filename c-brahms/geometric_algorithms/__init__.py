# @TODO SETUP.PY
# once we figure out the workflow, we can settle on a package structure and make our setup.py

# @TODO JUPYTER !!!
# also can't do till we settle on the workflow

# @TODO ALGORITHMS Test interval settings, also why is it broken on the fugues?

# @TODO LOGGERS
# Make loggers for each algorithm, store it in the init, so we can choose which ones we get output from?
# do we need to test loggers?

.. attribute:: Rules.forbidHiddenOctaves

	True by default. If True, :meth:`~music21.figuredBass.possibility.hiddenOctave` is applied to all (possibA, possibB) pairs, and all those pairs for which the method returns False are retained.

.. attribute:: Rules.partMovementLimits

	[] (empty list) by default. Contains (partNumber, maxSeparation) pairs provided as arguments to :meth:`~music21.figuredBass.possibility.partMovementsWithinLimits`.
	Method is applied to all (possibA, possibB) pairs, and all those pairs for which the method returns True are retained.

.. attribute:: Rules.resolveAugmentedSixthProperly

	True by default. If True, Segments whose :attr:`~music21.figuredBass.segment.Segment.segmentChord` spells out an augmented sixth chord are resolved properly by using :meth:`~music21.figuredBass.segment.Segment.resolveAugmentedSixthSegment`.

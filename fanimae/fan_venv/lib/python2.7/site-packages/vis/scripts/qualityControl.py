class QualityControl(object):
    """
    Contains basic checks to see if a piece symbolic notation is probably notated correctly. Note 
    that there is no guarantee that all encoding mistakes will be found and this currently only 
    offers checks for the most egregious errors. These checks are intended for the SIMSSA Database. 
    Here's a sample of how to use this class to check the integrity of a piece's encoding. "Result" 
    will contain measure_checker()'s 2-tuple return value:

    >>> test = QualityControl()
    >>> result = test.measure_checker(path_to_piece_in_symbolic_notation)

        returns: A 2-tuple of (True, list_of_piece's_parts) if the conversion was successfully 
            imported by music21, or a 1-tuple (False,) if the conversion failed.

        mistakes of this nature as the vast majority (if not all) of the pieces in the SIMSSA 
        Database should have parts that change measures at the same exact offsets.

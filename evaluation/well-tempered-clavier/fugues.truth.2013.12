# This dataset gives a ground truth analysis for :
#  - the 24 fugues of the first book of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier (WTC I), BWV 846-893,
#  - and the 12 first fugues from Shostakovich 24 Preludes and Fugues (op. 57, 1952).
# The ground truth is based on several musicological sources as well as on our own
# analysis.
